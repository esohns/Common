open issues:

- verify the timer manager implementation (heap/wheel); apparently, it has some stability issues
- verify that the timer manager implementation (timer wheel) timer cancellation is working correctly
 (it seems that timers are not correctly removed in all cases --> the dispatching thread never sleeps)
