# currently there is a *bug* in ntfs-3g that (auto-)mounts partitions in
# /etc/fstab with 'nosuid,nodev' options (try it, check with 'cat /proc/mounts').
# The problem does not occur when mounting paritions 'manually' (i.e. calling
# 'mount.ntfs' directly)
# --> use this script as a *workaround* to mount ntfs-3g partitions, copy/link
#     to '/etc/init.d' (YMMV) to load on startup
# return value: - 0 success, 1 failure

# sanity checks
